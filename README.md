# OpenGLGame

This is a game I am making after learning what I could from my other projects.
It is being built using JOGL. There is none of their code in this repository but you can get it on their webpage so you can run the code yourself.
Currently the game uses over 4gb of ram so you may want to allocate at least 4gb to Java.
