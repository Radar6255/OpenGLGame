# OpenGLGame

This is a game I am making after learning what I could from my other projects.  
It is being built using JOGL. There is none of their code in this repository but you can get it on their webpage so you can run the code yourself.  
Once you set up JOGL then you should start in a new world that will be saved in worldDIMENSION.dat files in the running directory.  
  
Move with the arrow keys, jump dimensions with c, fly with f.  
To place different blocks use the number keys to change which block to place then right click.
