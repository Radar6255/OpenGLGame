# OpenGLGame

This is a game I am making after learning what I could from my other projects.
It is being built using JOGL. There is none of their code in this repository but you can get it on their webpage so you can run the code yourself.
Once you set up JOGL then you should start in a new world that will be saved in a world.dat in the running directory. To place different blocks use the number keys to change which block to place then right click.
